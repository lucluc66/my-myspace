# My Myspace

Objective: Write an HTML document and style it with a CSS file.

Remember MySpace? Me neither. Even though it was a little before my time, I always loved the idea of having your own web page that evokes your own personal flair. As a result, I want to design my own personal website that mimics the purpose of a MySpace page (it does not have to look exactly the same, just serve the same purpose). Here is my shot of writing my own personal website and practice with HTML and CSS.
